# QUDOS: Quantum Occupation Dynamics Simulation

This repository contains simulation codes for the occupation dynamics of a **4-level quantum system**.  
The software is designed to assist researchers and students in the field of **quantum optics** in gaining a better understanding of the behavior of 4-level quantum systems and various excitation schemes.

In simple terms, the software can simulate:

- Resonant Excitation  
- Two-Photon Excitation  
- The SUPER Scheme  
- Stimulated Two-Photon Excitation  
- Chirp laser pulses for Adiabatic Rapid Passage
